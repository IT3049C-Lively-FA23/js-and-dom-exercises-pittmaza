## Self-Reflection:

Working with event listeners was a very interesting activity. It's very cool to see how data is binded in the HTML and how it can change with the help of JavaScript.
Although trying to understand event handlers was a bit challenging at first, I've developed an extremely great idea as to how they work and how they can be used to make powerful websites.

### How long it took you to finish this?

About 3 hours.
